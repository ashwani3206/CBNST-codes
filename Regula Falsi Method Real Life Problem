**Problem:** Consider a scenario where a chemical reaction in a laboratory is producing a certain compound, and you want to determine the time it takes for the concentration of the compound to reach a specific level. The rate of change of concentration over time follows a mathematical function, and you need to find the time when the concentration reaches a certain threshold.

**Mathematical Model:** Let's assume the concentration of the compound, C(t), at time t, follows an exponential decay model:

```
C(t) = C0 * e^(-kt)
```

Where:
- `C(t)` is the concentration at time t.
- `C0` is the initial concentration at `t = 0`.
- `k` is the rate constant.
- `t` is time.

You want to find the value of `t` when `C(t)` reaches a certain threshold concentration, say `C_threshold`.

**Solution using Regula Falsi in C:**

Here's a C code example to find the time `t` when the concentration `C(t)` reaches a specific threshold `C_threshold` using the Regula Falsi method:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

// Define the function to find the root of (C(t) - C_threshold)
double function(double C0, double k, double t, double C_threshold) {
    return C0 * exp(-k * t) - C_threshold;
}

// Implement the Regula Falsi method
double regulaFalsi(double C0, double k, double a, double b, double C_threshold, double tolerance) {
    double c;
    
    while (1) {
        // Calculate the values of the function at the endpoints and midpoint
        double fa = function(C0, k, a, C_threshold);
        double fb = function(C0, k, b, C_threshold);
        c = (a * fb - b * fa) / (fb - fa);
        
        // Check if the solution is within the specified tolerance
        if (fabs(b - a) < tolerance) {
            return c;
        }
        
        double fc = function(C0, k, c, C_threshold);
        
        if (fa * fc < 0) {
            b = c;
        } else {
            a = c;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    double C0 = 100.0;          // Initial concentration at t = 0
    double C_threshold = 10.0;  // Threshold concentration
    double k = 0.05;            // Rate constant
    double a = 0.0;             // Initial interval endpoint
    double b = 10.0;            // Initial interval endpoint
    double tolerance = 1e-6;    // Tolerance for convergence

    double t = regulaFalsi(C0, k, a, b, C_threshold, tolerance);

    printf("Time to reach %.2lf concentration: %.6lf seconds\n", C_threshold, t);

    return 0;
}
```

In this C code:

- The `function` function calculates the difference between `C(t)` and `C_threshold`.
- The `regulaFalsi` function implements the Regula Falsi method to find the time `t` when `C(t)` reaches `C_threshold`.
- The main function initializes the problem parameters, such as the initial concentration, threshold concentration, rate constant, initial interval, and tolerance. It then calls the `regulaFalsi` function to find the time `t` and prints the result.

When you run this C program, it will estimate the time `t` when the concentration reaches the specified threshold and print the result.
