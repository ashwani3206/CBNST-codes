**Problem:** Suppose you are managing a budget for a small business and need to determine the costs associated with different types of expenses, such as rent, utilities, and employee salaries. You have collected data for a particular month and formulated a system of linear equations to represent the expenses. You want to use the Gauss elimination method to solve this system and determine the individual expenses.

**System of Linear Equations:**

Let's assume you have the following system of linear equations:

```
1.  Rent + Utilities + Salaries = 5000
2.  Rent + 2 * Utilities + 3 * Salaries = 12000
3.  2 * Rent + 3 * Utilities + 4 * Salaries = 22000
```

**Solution using Gauss Elimination in C:**

Here's a C code example to solve the system of linear equations using the Gauss elimination method:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void gaussElimination(double A[3][4], int n) {
    int i, j, k;
    double factor, sum;
    
    for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            factor = A[j][i] / A[i][i];
            
            for (k = i; k < n + 1; k++) {
                A[j][k] = A[j][k] - factor * A[i][k];
            }
        }
    }

    // Back substitution
    double X[n];
    for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        sum = 0.0;
        for (j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            sum += A[i][j] * X[j];
        }
        X[i] = (A[i][n] - sum) / A[i][i];
    }

    printf("Solution:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("Expense %d: $%.2lf\n", i + 1, X[i]);
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 3; // Number of equations and variables
    double A[3][4] = {
        {1, 1, 1, 5000},
        {1, 2, 3, 12000},
        {2, 3, 4, 22000}
    };

    gaussElimination(A, n);

    return 0;
}
```

In this C code:

- `gaussElimination` is a function that performs Gaussian elimination to solve the system of linear equations.
- The `A` matrix represents the coefficients of the equations and the right-hand side values.
- After solving the system, the code prints out the individual expenses for rent, utilities, and salaries.

When you run this C program, it will calculate and display the expenses based on the given system of linear equations.
