**Problem:** Imagine you are planning to build a rectangular garden in your backyard. You want to determine the dimensions of the garden such that its area is maximized while staying within a given perimeter. You have a fixed amount of fencing material to enclose the garden, which limits the perimeter. You need to find the dimensions that maximize the garden's area.

**Mathematical Model:** Let's assume the length of the rectangular garden is \(L\) meters, and the width is \(W\) meters. The perimeter of the garden is given by:

[P = 2L + 2W]

And the area of the garden is given by:

[A = L * W]

You have a fixed perimeter \(P\) (e.g., 100 meters), and you want to find the values of \(L\) and \(W\) that maximize \(A\) (the area).

**Solution using the Quadratic Formula in C:**

Here's a C code example to find the dimensions \(L\) and \(W\) that maximize the garden's area using the quadratic formula:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double P; // Perimeter of the garden
    double L, W; // Length and width of the garden
    double maxArea; // Maximum area of the garden
    
    // Input the perimeter P
    printf("Enter the perimeter of the garden (in meters): ");
    scanf("%lf", &P);
    
    // Calculate the dimensions L and W that maximize the area
    L = P / 4.0; // Initialize L based on a square shape
    W = P / 4.0; // Initialize W based on a square shape
    maxArea = L * W; // Initialize maxArea based on the square shape
    
    // Check if a rectangle with different dimensions can yield a larger area
    for (double potentialL = 1.0; potentialL <= P / 2.0; potentialL += 0.01) {
        double potentialW = (P - 2 * potentialL) / 2.0;
        double potentialArea = potentialL * potentialW;
        if (potentialArea > maxArea) {
            L = potentialL;
            W = potentialW;
            maxArea = potentialArea;
        }
    }
    
    // Output the dimensions and maximum area
    printf("Dimensions that maximize area:\n");
    printf("Length (L): %.2lf meters\n", L);
    printf("Width (W): %.2lf meters\n", W);
    printf("Maximum Area (A): %.2lf square meters\n", maxArea);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this C code:

- The user is prompted to input the perimeter \(P\) of the garden.
- The code initializes \(L\) and \(W\) based on a square shape, as this is one possible solution.
- It then iterates through different potential lengths \(L\) to find the dimensions that maximize the area. The dimensions are updated when a larger area is found.
- Finally, the code outputs the dimensions and maximum area.

This program helps you determine the dimensions of a rectangular garden that maximize its area within a given perimeter.
